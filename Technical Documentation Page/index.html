          <header> Javascript
          </header>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements </p>

              <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
        identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
      <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters
        can
        also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
        (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
      <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
        sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

          <p>
        The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
        <ul>
          <li>Six data types that are primitives:
            <ul>
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the
                same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
              <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
              <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
         
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your
        applications.</p><p> Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
        objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to
        execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
        <code>
  if (condition) {

    statement_1;
  
  } else {
    
    statement_2;
  
  }
        </code>
        </p><p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
        evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is
        executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
      </p>
       <code>
  if (condition_1) {
            
    statement_1;

  } else if (condition_2) {
    
    statement_2;
    
  } else if (condition_n) {
  
    statement_n;
  
  } else {
  
    statement_last;
  
  } 
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed.
        To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
        to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
        <code>
  if (condition) {

    statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;

    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;

  } else {

    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;

    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;

  }
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
        confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        <code>
  if (x = y) { 
    
    /* statements here */
  
  }
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
        parentheses around the assignment. For example:
        <code>
  if ((x = y)) {
  
    /* statements here */
  
  }
        </code>

          </header><p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault.</p><p> Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace.</p><p> A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power.</p>
